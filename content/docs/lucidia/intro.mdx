# Lucidia Overview

Lucidia is the ambient companion embedded in the BlackRoad desktop. It listens for context, proposes next actions, and can hand off tasks to specialized agents without leaving your workspace.

## What Lucidia does

- **Context awareness**: Reads the active window, selection, and environment to ground suggestions.
- **Action handoff**: Routes requests to the right agent pack while keeping users in the loop.
- **Inline guidance**: Surfaces shortcuts, safety warnings, and remediation checklists directly in the UI.
- **Learning loop**: Captures feedback to tune prompts and tool preferences without changing code in the shell.

## Interaction patterns

- Pin Lucidia to the dock for quick prompts or open it as a **side panel** beside dashboards.
- Use **inline suggestions** when filling forms or triaging incidents; Lucidia can pre-fill data from recent events.
- When Lucidia cannot act autonomously, it suggests the best agent to take over and explains why.

## Building with Lucidia

- Provide **structured context** from pages and components (entity IDs, selected rows, filters) so suggestions stay relevant.
- Respect **privacy boundaries**: do not stream sensitive data unless the environment policies allow it.
- Expose **clear controls** for dismissing or downgrading suggestions so operators feel in control.
