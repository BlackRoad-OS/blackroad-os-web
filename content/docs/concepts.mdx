# Core Concepts

BlackRoad OS is a composable surface for orchestrating autonomous operations. The platform combines a browser-native desktop, an operator engine for routing intelligence, and an agent mesh that adapts to production signals.

## System layers

- **Desktop shell (this repo)**: Renders the BlackRoad workspace with windows, panes, and navigation primitives so humans and agents share a common surface.
- **Operator engine**: Normalizes requests, applies policies, and calls the right runtime (LLMs, tools, data planes) while enforcing audit and safety gates.
- **Agent mesh**: A registry of typed agents, packs, and behaviors that can be invoked directly or composed into larger playbooks.
- **Observability spine**: Every layer reports health, readiness, traces, and metrics so operators can spot regressions quickly.

## Workspaces and environments

Work happens inside **orgs → environments → workspaces**:

- Use environments (local, staging, prod) to isolate data-plane integrations and secrets.
- Workspaces group related apps (status, console, docs) and saved layouts so teams can resume where they left off.
- Navigation should always communicate the current org and environment so actions stay scoped.

## Events over imperative scripts

BlackRoad favors **events and contracts** instead of handwritten glue code:

- Inputs and outputs are described with typed payloads that the operator engine validates before execution.
- Agents publish structured events (success, degraded, remediation-started) that feed dashboards and prompts.
- Deterministic fallbacks keep degraded flows usable: timeouts, retries with backoff, and circuit-breaker semantics.

## Safety and policy

- All agent calls pass through policy checks (allowed tools, data residency, PII handling) defined per environment.
- User-facing errors should stay human-readable and avoid leaking internal IDs or stack traces.
- Long-running tasks stream status updates so operators know whether to wait, cancel, or escalate.

## Extensibility patterns

- Build new windows or panels as **small, composable React components** with clear loading and error states.
- Prefer server-provided capabilities over hardcoded rules; the web shell reflects what the operator engine exposes.
- Add feature flags for experimental agents or UI affordances so they can be rolled out progressively.
