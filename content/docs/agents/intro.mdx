# Agents and Packs

Agents are reusable automation personas backed by prompts, tools, and policies. They can run fully autonomously or co-pilot with humans from the BlackRoad desktop.

## Agent anatomy

- **Identity**: Name, description, and owner for auditability.
- **Persona**: Guardrailed prompt scaffolding that shapes tone, decision-making, and escalation rules.
- **Capabilities**: Assigned packs that expose concrete actions (open incident, query metrics, file reports).
- **Safety rails**: Allowed tools, rate limits, and masking rules defined per environment.

## Pack assignment

- Packs are attached to agents through the Operator with explicit versions so upgrades are controlled.
- Each pack declares inputs/outputs; the UI should surface these in forms so users know what is required.
- When a pack is unavailable, the shell should show the degraded state and offer alternative actions.

## Collaboration patterns

- Use **co-pilot mode** for risky actions: the agent drafts a plan, the human approves execution.
- Agents emit **breadcrumbs** while working so operators can follow progress, cancel, or nudge.
- For recurring work, pin agent shortcuts to the dock or workspace layout so teams can trigger flows quickly.

## Readiness checklist

- Every new agent should have an assigned owner, escalation path, and rollback strategy.
- Confirm observability hooks are wired (traces + metrics) before exposing an agent to production users.
- Document expected inputs, response formats, and failure modes in the Codex so other teams can adopt the agent safely.
