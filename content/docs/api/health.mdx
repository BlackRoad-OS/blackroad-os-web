# Health Endpoints

BlackRoad exposes lightweight health signals so operators and probes can verify the stack without expensive calls. Use these endpoints for uptime checks, dashboards, and local smoke tests.

## `/api/health` and `/health`

- **Purpose**: Confirm the web shell is running and able to serve requests.
- **Example response:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "blackroad-os-web",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "region": "local",
  "dependencies": {
    "contentlayer": "ready",
    "next": "ready"
  }
}
```

- **Usage**: Ideal for liveness probes and quick diagnostics from the status page.

## `/api/ready`

- **Purpose**: Indicates the service is ready to handle real traffic without relying on external networks.
- **Behavior**: Returns `{ ready: true }` when internal initialization completes; does not fan out to other systems.
- **Usage**: Pair with `/api/health` to separate startup readiness from ongoing liveness.

## `/api/version` and `/version`

- **Purpose**: Report build metadata for traceability.
- **Fields**: service name, semantic version, commit SHA, and environment tag.
- **Usage**: Expose version info in dashboards or attach it to bug reports when filing incidents.

## Operational guidance

- Cache responses briefly in monitoring tools to reduce noise but alert on sustained failures.
- When adding new services behind the shell, extend the response payload with dependency checks and timestamps.
- Document any health semantics changes in the Codex so downstream teams update their monitors.
