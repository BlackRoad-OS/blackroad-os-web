# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the BlackRoad web portal locally for development.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm 10.11.0 (required package manager)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-web.git
cd blackroad-os-web
pnpm install
```

## Running locally

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the portal in your browser. The dev server supports hot reloading for instant feedback.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure your environment variables:

```bash
SITE_URL=https://blackroad.io
PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=analytics.blackroad.io
```

## Building for production

Create a static export:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The static site is emitted to `.out/`. Serve it locally with:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Testing

Run all tests (Vitest + Playwright):

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```
