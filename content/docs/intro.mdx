# Introduction

BlackRoad is a composable agent orchestration platform for autonomous operations. Built with observability-ready primitives and event-driven flows.

## Key Features

- **Composable agents**: Wire services, signals, and humans together with event-driven flows
- **Predictable control**: Typed contracts, deterministic fallbacks, and audited traces by default
- **Built for operations**: Observability-ready primitives with live dashboards and dark-mode UI
- **Static-first delivery**: Fast, secure, and scalable public documentation surface
